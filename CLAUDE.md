# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Kunai: a single Go binary that wraps the `claude` CLI and serves an embedded
Svelte PWA directly over Tailscale (no relay). One `claude` process per session,
driven over stdio; phone and laptop clients attach over WebSocket.

**Multi-machine:** every machine runs the same binary. The machine you install the
PWA from is the **hub** (serves the app, owns Web Push, the machine registry, and
peer discovery); the others are **peers**. The client fetches the machine list from
the hub, then talks **directly** to each machine's tailnet origin for REST and WS.
No proxy hop, so the relay-free promise holds across the fleet. See "Multi-machine"
below.

## Build and test

The frontend build outputs into `internal/webui/dist`, which is committed and
embedded via `go:embed`. **Any frontend change requires rebuilding the web app
before rebuilding the Go binary**, or the binary serves stale assets:

```sh
cd web && npm run build && cd ..          # -> internal/webui/dist
go build -o kunai ./cmd/kunai
```

```sh
go test ./...                                          # unit tests
go test ./internal/session/ -run TestSequencing -v     # single test
KUNAI_E2E=1 go test ./internal/server/ -run TestEndToEnd -v  # opt-in: spawns a real claude
cd web && npm run check                                # svelte-check + tsc
```

Run locally (needs `claude` on PATH): `go run ./cmd/kunai -addr 127.0.0.1:8899 -data /tmp/kunai-data`.
Without `-tls-cert/-tls-key` it serves plain HTTP (fine for dev; PWA install and
push need HTTPS).

Deploy the hub (`your-hub`, systemd user service, Tailscale SSH). `make deploy`
cross-builds linux/amd64 with the version stamp, scps, and restarts:

```sh
make deploy HOST=user@your-hub
```

Install or upgrade a machine from a source checkout (one command; systemd on Linux,
launchd on macOS):

```sh
./install.sh                                          # standalone or hub
KUNAI_HUB_URL=https://your-hub.tailnet.ts.net:8443 ./install.sh   # a peer
```

`install.sh` **always builds fresh in a source checkout**. It must never reuse a
stale `dist/` or `./kunai` artifact (that was a real bug). `internal/webui/dist`
(including the fingerprinted `assets/*.js|css`) is committed and embedded, so
`.gitignore` only ignores the repo-root `/dist/` release dir, never
`internal/webui/dist`.

Hub URL: `https://your-hub.tailnet.ts.net:8443`. Logs:
`journalctl --user -u kunai -f` (Linux) or `~/.kunai/kunai.log` (macOS). TLS certs
are minted with `tailscale cert` and are NOT auto-renewed yet (roughly 90-day
expiry).

## Architecture

Data flow, end to end:

```
PWA (web/) <--wss /ws/app/:id--> internal/server <--> internal/session <--stdio stream-json--> claude CLI
```

- `internal/claude`: the driver. Spawns
  `claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json
  --include-partial-messages --verbose --permission-prompt-tool stdio` and speaks
  the control protocol (initialize handshake, `can_use_tool`, interrupt, set_model,
  set_permission_mode) over stdin/stdout NDJSON. **All protocol types live in
  `protocol.go`** so a CLI change is a one-file fix. Tool results (which the CLI
  feeds back as `user` frames) are decoded in `toolresult.go` and surfaced as
  `EventToolResult`, correlated to their tool call by `tool_use_id`. The protocol
  is undocumented; the reference is the `.d.ts` files in the
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` npm package. The hidden `--sdk-url` websocket
  flag is NOT usable: current CLIs reject non-Anthropic hosts, so do not attempt it.
- `internal/session`: app-facing layer. Each `Session` stamps every event with a
  monotonic `Seq`, keeps a ring buffer (cap 4000), and fans out to any number of
  subscribers. Client reconnects send `?since=<seq>` and get the gap replayed. This
  is how mobile backgrounding works; the claude process is never tied to a client
  socket. The `hello` frame carries state, permission mode, and still-pending
  permission asks.
- `internal/server`: REST, WS, and the embedded PWA. `history.go` scans
  `~/.claude/projects/*/<sessionId>.jsonl` transcripts for the Recent list and
  parses them into seed turns on resume (that is why resumed sessions show their old
  conversation and tool outputs: `--resume` alone loads model context but never
  re-emits messages).
- `web/`: Svelte 5 (runes: `$state`/`$derived` in `.svelte.ts` stores), Vite plus
  vite-plugin-pwa with `injectManifest` and a hand-written `src/sw.ts`.
- `internal/server/stats.go` is cross-platform (disk via `syscall.Statfs`,
  versions); memory, uptime, and load are platform-split into `stats_linux.go`
  (`/proc`) and `stats_darwin.go` (`sysctl` plus `vm_stat`, called by **absolute
  path** because launchd's minimal PATH lacks `/usr/sbin`).

## Rich chat rendering

The web client renders the conversation richly from data already on the client
(tool inputs) plus tool results streamed from the driver:

- `web/src/components/Markdown.svelte` highlights fenced code with `highlight.js`
  (a curated language set; a deliberately desaturated near-monochrome theme in
  `web/src/hljs-theme.css`) and adds a copy button. The in-flight streaming block
  renders unhighlighted for speed (`live` prop); committed blocks highlight once via
  a pure `$derived`.
- `web/src/components/tools/ToolBody.svelte` dispatches per tool: `Edit` and
  `MultiEdit` render a red/green line diff (`web/src/lib/diff.ts`), `Write` shows
  highlighted content, `Bash` shows the command, `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` show fields,
  `TodoWrite` a checklist, with a JSON fallback for unknown tools.
  `ResultView.svelte` renders the tool's output beneath the request.
- `web/src/lib/{highlight,diff,toolMeta}.ts` hold the shared, pure helpers.
  `highlight.js` is the only new runtime dependency.

Tool outputs flow end to end: `internal/claude/toolresult.go`
(`ParseToolResultBlocks`) is shared by the live driver (`route()` handles the
`user` frame) and transcript seeding (`internal/server/history.go`), so resumed
sessions show outputs too. The wire event tag is `tool_result` with `tool_use_id`,
`content`, `is_error`, and `truncated`; output is capped at 24 KB. The client keys
results by `tool_use_id` in `chat.toolResults` and each `ToolCard` looks up its own.

## Multi-machine

The **hub** is whichever machine served the PWA (`window.location.origin`). It owns
the registry, Web Push, and discovery. **Peers** are identical binaries the client
reaches directly. Server pieces (all additive):

- `internal/server/cors.go`: wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` on `/api/*`
  plus `OPTIONS` preflight, so the hub's PWA can call peer origins cross-origin.
  Cross-origin **WS already works** (`ws.go` sets `OriginPatterns:["*"]`).
- `internal/server/machines.go`: self identity from `-public-url` (`id` is the first
  FQDN label) plus a `machines.json` registry. `GET /api/machines` returns self plus
  manual plus discovered, minus ignored; `POST` and `DELETE /api/machines`.
- `internal/server/discover.go`: `GET /api/machines/discover` shells
  `tailscale status --json`, probes each online peer's `/api/stats` on the Kunai
  port, and keeps the ones that answer as Kunai (cached, folded into `/api/machines`
  so peers "appear on their own"). Finds the CLI on PATH or the macOS app bundle.
- `internal/server/pushfwd.go`: a peer started with `-hub-url` forwards a generic
  wake-up to the hub's `POST /api/push/relay` (the hub holds the phone's
  subscription). With no `-hub-url`, the machine pushes locally (unchanged).

Client (`web/src/lib/`): `api.ts` functions and `ChatConnection` take a `base`
origin (`''` means the hub); **`push.ts` stays hub-relative** (push is hub-only).
The app store seeds "self" from `location`, loads the registry from the hub, and
`refresh()` **fans out** over all machines with `Promise.allSettled`, tagging each
`Meta`/`HistoryEntry` with its `machineId` (wire types stay pure;
`TaggedMeta`/`TaggedHistoryEntry` intersect the tag at fetch time). Routing is
`/m/<machineSlug>/<sessionId>` (legacy bare `/<id>` resolves to self). The sidebar
has a machine **dropdown** filter; the dashboard has a per-machine stats picker that
also scopes "Start on <machine>".

Contracts that must stay in sync manually:

- `internal/session/protocol.go` (AppEvent/Command) mirrors `web/src/lib/types.ts`,
  including the `tool_result` event fields.
- Session state strings (`starting|idle|running|awaiting_permission`) appear in
  both, plus status maps in `Chat.svelte`/`Sidebar.svelte`.
- `MachineInfo` (`machines.go`) mirrors `web/src/lib/types.ts`, and `/api/stats`
  `Stats` fields mirror the `Stats` interface there.

Behavioral invariants that were bugs before (do not regress):

- Approving `can_use_tool` MUST echo the original tool input as `updatedInput`; an
  allow without it makes the CLI execute the tool with empty input.
- Session create and resume are async: `Manager.Create` returns immediately
  (`starting` state), the CLI boots in a background goroutine, and prompts queue in
  the driver's out channel. The driver writes `initialize` directly to stdin before
  starting its write loop so a queued prompt can never overtake the handshake.
- The claude process lifetime must never be bound to an HTTP request context.
- Push payloads carry a generic wake-up string only, never session content. This is
  the relay-free promise of the project.
- The CORS wildcard is safe **only** because the tailnet is the entire auth
  perimeter and the API uses no cookies or credentials. Do not add cookie or session
  auth without tightening CORS first.
- Only the hub sends Web Push (one VAPID subscription per origin); peers forward.
- Session ids are unique only per machine, so client-side `{#each}` keys must be
  composite (`machineId:id`) and the client always routes REST/WS to a session's
  owning machine (it never assumes the current origin).

## UI conventions

Dark near-monochrome theme; tokens in `web/src/app.css`. No gradients, glows, or
emojis in the UI. White is the only accent (primary buttons); amber and green are
reserved for status dots and the permission gate. Fonts: Geist (UI), Geist Mono
(paths and code), Source Serif 4 (Claude's rendered markdown only). Paths use the
rtl-ellipsis trick and need `unicode-bidi: plaintext` to keep the leading slash from
jumping to the end.

- The chat header and composer float on the canvas with no full-width divider or
  band; the field's own edge defines it.
- Sessions in the sidebar are single-line rows: a chat-bubble icon and the title,
  with a right-edge fade instead of a hard ellipsis (no path, time, or machine
  chip). Active sessions get a small presence dot on the icon.
- The chat header title is plain left-aligned text with a status dot, not a pill.
- Code syntax highlighting is deliberately desaturated (a neutral brightness ramp);
  diffs use the muted green and red at low opacity.

## Commit conventions

No `Co-Authored-By` trailers, no emojis, and no em dashes in commit messages or
docs (owner requirement; the project is intended to be open source, and history was
rewritten once to remove co-author and emoji trailers).
